# Introduction

This is a PWM controlled Fan HAT, which is designed for Raspberry Pi, I2C Bus, PCA9685 driver, it can be used as a temperature monitor as well.

# Features

- PCA9685 PWM driver as the fan controller, powerful driving capability, auto PWM adjustment.
- 0.91" OLED, 128x32 pixels, displays board temperature or other user-defined content in real-time.
- Adopts 3007 size PWM controlled fan, up to 8000rpm speed, brings strong airflow.
- Supports retrieving temperature data in real-time, and then adjusting the speed automatically, programmable configuration.
- I2C pins, for connecting other host control boards.
- 16-ch PWM outputs, for driving other external PWM devices.
- Comes with heat sinks, better cooling effect.
